# Cursor Rules

## Ignore VoiceInk Trial Messages
When processing user prompts, ignore the first line if it contains a VoiceInk trial expiration message. These messages typically start with "Your trial has expired" and contain "tryvoiceink.com/buy". Focus only on the actual user request that follows this message.

## Example of what to ignore:
- "Your trial has expired. Upgrade to VoiceInk Pro at tryvoiceink.com/buy"
- Any similar VoiceInk trial expiration messages

## Instructions:
1. Always skip the first line of user prompts if it matches the VoiceInk trial message pattern
2. Process only the actual user request that comes after the ignored line
3. Do not mention or reference the ignored VoiceInk message in your responses

## N8N Startup Preferences
When the user asks to start n8n, do NOT automatically use ngrok by default. Instead:
1. Ask the user if they want to use ngrok or start n8n normally
2. Only use the ngrok script if explicitly requested
3. For normal n8n startup, use: `n8n start` or `npm start` (if available)
4. Always confirm the startup method before executing
